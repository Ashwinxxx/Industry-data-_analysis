CYCLONE SENSOR DATA ANALYSIS - KEY INSIGHTS
============================================================

INSIGHT 1 - Shutdown Patterns:
- Total downtime: 169.1 days (12.9% of operational time)
- Average shutdown duration: 9.9 hours
- Number of shutdowns: 408
- Recommendation: Investigate frequent short shutdowns for prevention opportunities.


INSIGHT 2 - Operational State Distribution:
- High load state (Cluster 2): 71.2% of active time
- Low load state (Cluster 1): 6.6% of active time
- Recommendation: Optimize for most frequent operational state to maximize efficiency.


INSIGHT 3 - Anomaly Characteristics:
- Total anomalous events: 395
- Average anomaly duration: 78.6 minutes
- Cluster with most anomalies: Cluster 2 (256 events)
- Recommendation: Implement real-time monitoring for Cluster 2.


INSIGHT 4 - Process Relationships:
- Inlet Temperature-Draft correlation: -0.902
- Strong temperature-draft coupling indicates well-controlled process
- Recommendation: Monitor for correlation breakdown as early warning sign.


INSIGHT 5 - Predictive Maintenance Opportunities:
- Short-term forecasts show good accuracy during stable operation
- Forecast degradation occurs before shutdowns and during state transitions
- Recommendation: Use rolling forecast error as predictive maintenance indicator.
